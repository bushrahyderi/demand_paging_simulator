Demand Paging Simulator

Demand paging is a memory management scheme where a page of memory is brought into the physical memory only when it is needed (on-demand) by the executing program. This is in contrast to pre-paging where pages are brought into memory in anticipation of their use. The main advantage of demand paging is that it reduces the number of pages loaded into memory at any given time, thus conserving memory resources.
